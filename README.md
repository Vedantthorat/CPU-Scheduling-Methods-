# CPU-Scheduling-Methods-

ðŸ§  CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator in Python
This project is a Python-based simulation of fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms, including:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)

ðŸ“Œ Objective
The aim of this project is to provide a simple yet effective tool for understanding how different CPU scheduling algorithms work by simulating them with user input and visual output (via terminal or optional GUI).

ðŸš€ Features
Simulates the most commonly used CPU scheduling algorithms.

Allows user input for:

Number of processes

Arrival time

Burst time

Time quantum (for RR)

Priority levels (for Priority Scheduling)

Calculates:

Completion Time

Turnaround Time

Waiting Time

Gantt Chart representation

Clean output formatting for better understanding
